<h3>Yellowstone National Park FAQ:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Where do I Make Reservations to Stay in Yellowstone?

        Yellowstone National Park Lodges operates the nine lodges in the park. All are open from late spring through fall, but only two are open in the winter: Old Faithful Snow Lodge and Mammoth Hot Springs Hotel. Be sure to make a reservation early!</li>

    <li>How did Yellowstone get its name?

        Yellowstone National Park is named after the Yellowstone River, the major river running through the park. According to French-Canadian trappers in the 1800s, they asked the name of the river from the Minnetaree tribe, who live in what is now eastern Montana. They responded “Mi tse a-da-zi,” which literally translates as “Rock Yellow River.” The trappers translated this into French as “Roche Jaune” or “Pierre Jaune.” In 1797, explorer-geographer David Thompson used the English translation—“Yellow Stone.” Lewis and Clark called the Yellowstone River by the French and English forms. Subsequent use formalized the name as “Yellowstone.</li>

    <li>Can we swim in rivers and lakes?

        Swimming is not recommended because most lakes and streams are dangerously cold. Firehole Canyon, near Madison Junction, has a swimming area popular in summer. Soaking in thermal features is illegal. The area known as the Boiling River, north of Mammoth Hot Springs, allows soaking in the Gardner River near thermal outflow, but not in the feature itself. Soaking is allowed during daylight hours only and at your own risk.</li>

<h3>Glacier National Park FAQ:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>When will Going-to-the-Sun Road open?

        Plowing Going-to-the-Sun Road is a monumental challenge each year. Unpredictable spring snow storms or other weather related events can slow down plowing progress. It is not uncommon for plowing crews to need to re-plow sections of park roads when weather events happen. Safety for our plowing crews, contractors, and the public is our utmost concern and priority. These unknown factors make predicting the opening of Going-to-the-Sun Road impossible. Our plowing status page provides information on where plows are working. As the status of the road changes, we will immediately update our road status page. Portions of Going-to-the-Sun Road remain open all year and provide access to locations like Apgar Village and Lake McDonald Lodge. Please check our road status page for the sections of road that are open.</li>

    <li>What does it mean when a campground is in Primitive Status?

        Campgrounds in primitive status do not have flush toilets or potable water.</li>

    <li>Is hiking the Highline Trail scary?

        There are portions of the trail that have exposure, the most noticeable beginning one hundred yards or so from the trailhead at Logan Pass. The trail can be 3-5 feet wide in places. There is a hand cable available for about 50 yards. The Highline Trail is a gorgeous trail and provides access to the high country's stunning scenery.
